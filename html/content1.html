    <h2 class="lan" id="lan">LANs</h2>
    <p class='content2'>These systems are usually withinn one building, or certainly not
      far away from each other geographically. A typical LAN will consit of a
      number of computers anddevices (for example. prianters) that are connected to hubs or switches.
      One of the hubs or switches will usually be connected to a router and a modem
      (usually boradband) to allow the LAN to connect to the internet; in doing so
      it then becaomes part of a WAN.
    </p>
    <h2 class="wan" id="wan">WANs</h2>
    <p class="content2">
      Wide area networks are used where computers or networks are as mentioned ealier,
      if anumber of LANs are joined toegther using a rounter or
      modem, then they can form a number of LANs are joined toegther using a router or modem,
      then they can form a WAN. The most common examples of WAN include the internet and the network of ATMs
      (automated teller machines) used by banks.
      Because of the long distances between devices, WANs usually make us of some public  communication lines
      which can be less expenisve and also more secure (less risk of hacking).
      A typical WAN will consit of end systems and intermediate systems (see diagram).
      1, 3, 7 and 10 areknown as end systems and the remeander are known as end systems. The distance between
      each sstem can be considerable, especially if the WAN<br>is run by a multinational company.

    <h2 class="wlan" id="wlan">WLAN</h2>
    <p class="content2">
      Wiresless LANs (WLANs) are similar to LANS but there are no<br>
      wires or cables. In other words, they provide wireless network<br>
      communications over fairly short distances (a few metres) using<br>
      radio or infrared signals instead of cables. <br>
      <br>
      Devices, known as access points (APs) or wireless nodes, are<br>
      connected into the wired network at fixed locations. Because of<br>
      the limited range, most commercial LANs (for example, at a college<br>
      campus or at an airport) need several APs to permit uninterrupted<br>
      wireless communications. The APs use either spread spectrum technology<br>
      (which is a wideband radio requency with a range of about 30-50m)<br>
      or infrared (which has a very short range, about 1-2, and is<br>
      easily block; it there therefore has a limited use.)<br>
      <br>
      The AP receives and transmits data between the WLAN and the wired network structure. End-users access the WLAN
      through wireless LAN adapters that are built into the devices or are a plug-in-module.

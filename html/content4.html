<h2>How to protect your computer from viruses</h2>
<p class="vi">Running antivirus software in the background on a computer will constanly check 
  for virus attacks. Although various types of antivirus software work in different 
  ways they have many common features. Such as comparing a possible virus with known 
viruses in their database, etc.<br>
<br>
One way to help prevent virus attacls when accessing websites on the internet is 
to avoid unkown or suspicious-looking websites. If in doubt, don't access the website 1-2 
look for security indicators such as https or the padlock symbol.<br>
<br>
Also look out for odd behaviour in the URL when accessing a new website, for example 
from an advert in email, copy and paste the URL into the address bar at the top of the page 
rather than just cliking on the link in the email. This can help to avoid links to bogus/fake websites. <br>
<br>
It is also not advisable to open emails (or any attachments) from unknown sources. 
Essentially, the best form of defence against malicious behavior when making use of 
the internet is to apply common sense.

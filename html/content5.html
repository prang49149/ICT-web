<h2>Authentication</h2>
<p class="vi">
  Examples of authentication are digital cerificates, biomatrics and magnetic strip 
  cards/id cards/passports.<br>
  <br>
  Magnetic strip cards have a magnetic strip on one side (made up of tiny particles on 
  a plastic flim). each particle can act as anorth-pole or a south-pole 
  (which corresponds to the two binary values of 0 and 1).<br>
  <br>
  The strip is read by swiping it through a card reader. Data such as name, ID number 
  sex and date of birth may be contained on a magnetic stripe when used 
  as a security device to allow entry to a building, for example.<br>
  <br>
  Contactless cards can be read from a distance and don't have to be swiped through a 
  card reader. Contactless technology can be used in credit/debit cards, for example 
  to speed up payments in a shop, but they can also be used as a security device. If the card 
  is in a wallet or a pocket, as the owner of the card walks through a security gate,
  readers either side of the quickly scan the security data stored on the 
  tag/chip embedded in the card. Access will only be allowed if the scanned data 
  matches data in a database.<br>
  <br>
  Some ID cards also use a holographic iamge (hologram). These are designed to make forgery 
  of the card more difficult. Holograpahic images change colour or appear to have a moving object 
  when the image is viewed from a different angles. As these are difficult to make it stops somebody, 
  for example, simple photocopying a card and using it illegally.<br>
  <br>
  Another form of security is to have a photographic image of the card user printed on the card surface<br>
  <br>
  Passports make use of some of the technology described above. Many passports contain an 
  RFIED tag/chip, a photograph and a holographic image.

    <h2>Modems</h2>
    <p class="content2">
      Modems means 'modulator demodulator' and is a device that converts<br>
      (i.e. modulates) a computor's digital signal into an analogue signal for<br>
      tranmission over an existing telephone line. It also does the reverse<br>
      process, in that it converts analogue signals from a telephone line into<br>
      digital signals (demodulates) to enable the computer to process the data.<br>
      <br>
      Modems are essentially used to allow computers to<br>
      connect to networks  for example, the internet) over long<br>
      distances using the existing telephone networks.<br>
      <br>
      Dial-up modems operates a tranmission speeds of about 60 kilobits<br>
      per second, which is extremely slow by today's standards.

    <h2 class="ha">Hubs</h2>
    <p class="he">
      Hubs are hardware devices that can have a number of devices or computers
      connected to them. They are often used to connect together a number of devices
      to form a LAN - for example, a star network. It's main task is to take any data
      packet (this is a group of data being transmitted) received at one of it's ports
      and boardcast it to every computer in the network. This is essentially means that
      using a hub is not very secure or efficient method of data distribution.
    </p>
    <img src="images/hub.jpg" class="ho">
    <h2 class="ich">Switches</h2>
    <p class="swi">
      Switches are similar to hubs but are much more effcient in the way that
      they ditribute data packets. As with hubs, they connect a number of devices
      or computers together to form a LAN.<br>
      <br>
      However, unlike a hub, the switch checks the data packet recieved and
      works out its destination address (or addresses) and sends the data to the
      appropriate computer(s) only. This makes using a switch a more secure
      way of distributing data.<br>
      <br>
      Each devices or computer on a network has a media access control (MAC)
      address that uniquely identifles it. Data packets sent to switches will have
      a MAC address identifying the source of the data and additional addresses
      identifying each devices that should recieve the data.
    </p>
    <h2 class="bri">Bridge</h2>
    <p class="idg">
      Bridges are devices that connect one LAN to another LAN that<br>
      uses the same protocol (communication rules). They are often used<br>
      to connect together different parts of a LAN so that they can<br>
      function as a single LAN.<br>
      <br>
      Bridges tend to be used to interconnected LANs (or parts of LANs) since sending out every data
      packet to all possible destinations would quickly flood larger networks with unneccesary traffic.
      For this reason a router is used to communicate with other networks, such as the internet.
